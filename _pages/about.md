Hello, my name is Kevin. I was an intern at IBM Design, and I've recently graduated from Cornell.  At school I TA'ed the physical computing class, [INFO4320](http://www.cornell.edu/video/rapid-prototyping-students-demo-inventions-sciencenter), where we built things with code, circuits and a willingness to make mistakes.
