Hi. My name is Kevin. I'm a maker from Beijing/Michigan with a passion for art and technology. I've worked with [HTC Magic Labs](http://gizmodo.com/5053464/htcs-magic-labs/) and
[IBM](http://www.ibm.com/design/) in the past.

I graduated from Cornell University in January 2017 with a degree in Human Computer Interaction and minor in Architecture. At school I was a research assistant and developer for the [Performance Apparel Lab](http://performancewear.human.cornell.edu/), [Development of Social Cognition Lab](http://dsclab.cornell.edu/), [Healthy Aging Lab](http://www.human.cornell.edu/hd/healthyaging/), and [Interaction Design Lab](http://idl.cornell.edu/).

I TA'ed Cornell's physical computing class, [INFO4320](http://www.cornell.edu/video/rapid-prototyping-students-demo-inventions-sciencenter), where we built things with code, circuits and a willingness to make mistakes.
