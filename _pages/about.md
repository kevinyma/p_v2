Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm a maker from Beijing/Michigan with a passion for art and technology. I've worked with [HTC Magic Labs](http://gizmodo.com/5053464/htcs-magic-labs/) and
[IBM](http://www.ibm.com/design/) in the past. At school I TA'ed Cornell's physical computing class, [INFO4320](http://www.cornell.edu/video/rapid-prototyping-students-demo-inventions-sciencenter), where we built things with code, circuits and a willingness to make mistakes.
