Hello, my name is Kevin. I was an intern at IBM Design, and I've recently graduated from Cornell.  At school I TA'ed the physical computing class, [INFO4320](http://www.cornell.edu/video/rapid-prototyping-students-demo-inventions-sciencenter), where we built things with code, circuits and a willingness to make mistakes.

Hi! I'm Kevin Ma, a product designer and graduate from Cornell University's Information Science program.  I’m interested in how systematic and computational design processes can question the idea of what digital products can be.
</p>
<p>Previously I was a Product Design Intern at IBM and HTC. At school I developed web applications for the <a href="http://idl.cornell.edu/">Interaction Design Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~francois/">Guimbretiere Lab</a>, and helped teach a <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/video/rapid-prototyping-students-demo-inventions-sciencenter">physical computing class</a>.</p>

<p>I love to <a href="http://messybin.tumblr.com">draw</a>.</p>
