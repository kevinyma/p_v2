		Lego for the Blind
		</p>
		<p>
		In 2016, Matthew Shifrin, a blind high school student, created a system of instructions that allowed Lego to be built by the blind and visually impaired. 
		</p>
		<p>I found out about Matthew's project from a blog post that he shared on Facebook.</p>
		<p>
		Intrigued, I contacted Matthew to discuss bringing the project to a wider audience. I worked with Matthew to design and code a website that would do that.</p> 
		<p>
		Lego for the Blind recieved considerable press attention from a number media outlets, including AOL News, Popular Science, and Nerdist.</p>

	Designing for Accesibility
	</p>
	<p>
	Designing for complete visual impairment requires considerable attention to semantic layout of the code. The site was designed for, and fully tested by users employing screen-readers, who experience and navigate the site through audio.
