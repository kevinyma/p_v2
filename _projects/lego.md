		Lego for the Blind
		</p>
		<p>
		Matthew Shifrin is a high school student who created a system of instructions that allowed Lego to be built by the blind and visually impaired. 
		</p>
		<p>I found out about Matthew's work from a blog post that he wrote. Inspired by his vision, I contacted him to build a web application to share the project. Working with Matthew on accessibility, I designed and coded, and added illustrations to the final web site.</p> 
		<p>
		Later on, Lego for the Blind recieved considerable press attention from a number of science and media outlets.

	Designing for Accesibility
	</p>
	<p>
	Designing for complete visual impairment requires considerable attention to semantic layout of the code. The site was designed for, and fully tested by users employing screen-readers, who experience and navigate the site through audio.
