A3WR, the Asian and Asian American Welcome Reception is an annual event that brings various campus groups together to welcome incoming freshman and celebrate new beginnings. 

The challenge was to create a brand that would represent the event itself, the host--the Cornell Asian Pacific Islander Student Union (CAPSU), and the the greater community of the campus.
