			Research Division HR
			</p>
			<p>
			I led design and web development on the new web presence for the Research Division Human Resources Department.
			</p>
			<p>
			I set out to prototype and create a website that provided employees the tools and resources necessary to succeed in their jobs.

		<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2"><p>The process began with a user interview stage. We interviewed separate groups of candidate users - employees, managers, and HR administrators. I gathered extensive lists of HR-related work tasks that users performed on a routine basis, and the frustrations and pain points inherent in the process.

		As the HR employees and I organized our qualitative interview data, a dichotomy in use-cases became apparent. Some cases were extremely specific eg. looking for a specific document or how to start a certain process. Others were general, pertaining to an entire user demographic eg. timelines for newly hired employees.

			The information architecture organizes the site through the dimensions of <b>Task Category</b> and <b>User Demographic</b>. Both navigation structures can be accessed on any page.

		Topics and their subtopics were determined in initial interviews, and revised over a series of back and forths with candidate uers. I added search functionality when it was evident the number of documents that users would require access to.
