		Research Division HR
		</p>
		<p>
		I led design and web development on the new web presence for the Research Division Human Resources Department.
		</p>
		<p>
		I set out to prototype and create a website that would instill confidence in employees that their workplace could provide them the tools necessary to succeed in their jobs.
		</p>
		<p>
		</p>The project began with separate phases of interviews with separate groups of candidate users - employees, managers, and HR administrators. We gathered extensive lists of HR-related work tasks that users performed on a routine basis.

		<p>
		As we organized our qualitative interview data, a dichotomy in use-cases became apparent. Some cases were extremely specific eg. looking for a specific document or how to start a certain process. Others were general, pertaining to an entire user demographic eg. timelines for newly hired employees.
		</p><p>
		The information architecture we decided on organizes information by both <b>Task Category</b> and <b>User Demographic</b>. Both navigation structures can be accessed on any page.

		Topics and their subtopics were determined in initial interviews, and revised over a series of back and forths with candidate uers. I added search functionality when it was evident the number of documents that users would require access to.

		Visual Design
		</p>
		<p>
		I created a visual style guide in accordance with existing Cornell branding guidelines to create a consistent look and feel across the site, as well as for the future maintenance of the site.
