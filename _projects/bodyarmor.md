We start with a found object, the chest armor of a baseball catcher. If we think of the armor as a set of components which rely on one another to deliver functionality, an organizational heirarchy becomes apparent.

Following a systematic dissection of the object, these armor components (padding foam, stitching, plastic wrapper) began to inform architechtonic elements as structure, superstructure and membrane.

In the final stage of the project, the abstraction was situated on a physical site, as the armor would have been placed on a human body.
