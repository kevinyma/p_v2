The <b>Race and Empathy Project</b> is an art installation that aims to record and share the everyday stories of Cornellians that evoke racial empathy.

I designed and developed the software component. 


### Physical Space

When I was brought onto the project, Professors Loeckenhoff and Guimbretiere already had a rough idea of the space they wanted to create. 

[Brief summary of space. Include ear design, golden ratio, feeling of being drawn deep into an enclosure]

My task would be to design and program the interactivity that would be accessed at the deepest point in the space.

### Interactive Space

[my design goal. early mocks, why I picked my direction. ]

The primary functionality was outlined as follows: 

- Retrieve and listen to existing stories
- Record one's own story, to be sent to a private archive 

I decided early on that my primary design goal would be to encourage sharing.
