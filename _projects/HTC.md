	Emotar is a sticker creator that puts 3D avatars on top of cartoon animations. <a href="http://a16z.com/2016/06/17/stickers/">Sticker culture</a> is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/line-and-wechat-strike-advertising-gold-1466613181">deeply</a> <a href="https://qz.com/156030/line-is-betting-millions-that-virtual-bears-and-bunnies-will-sweep-the-west/">entrenched</a> in a number of messenging apps, including Wechat, Line and KakaoTalk. Emotar adds personalized stickers to the conversation.
	</p>
	<p>
	I worked on Emotar as a Product Designer Intern at HTC Research & Development. Our goals were to revise the creation process, and to make sharing an essential feature of the app.

		Strategy
		</p>
		<p>

		At the onset, we devised product goals for the next release of Emotar:
</p>
<ul>
		<li>Address pain points in the sticker creation flow</li>
		<li>Promote branded sharing by making sharing to social networks integral to the experience</li>
		<li>Implement AB tests</li>
</ul>

		<p>Address pain points in the sticker creation flow</p>

		<p>A UX researcher and I examined user testing results to discover that the sticker creation model was obfuscated by the existing interface. Affordances like swiping left and right to change stickers are initially unclear. <br><br>In addition, user drop-off was high after creating the first sticker, as users felt like the "Create" button was the only way to make a new sticker.

	<p>I prototyped and tested a solution that makes the entire process modular. Clear delineation is made between the objects and their corresponding interactions. <b>3D avatars</b> are used for the faces of interchangable <b>stickers</b> which are grouped by <b>sets</b>.</p>
	<p>
	The idea is that stickers can be created on-the-fly from components, rather than an arduous linear process. Behaviorally, this is intended to encourage creation and experimentation.

	<p>Promote Branded Sharing</p>

	<p>Quantitative data revealed the top social networks that our users were attempting to share to. I wanted to make it easier for users to share their stickers on these networks. I protoyped a direct share flow from the home page to various apps. </p>
