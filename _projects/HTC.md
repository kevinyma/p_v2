Product Design Internship at HTC. I worked on two apps that are now published on the Google Play Store: Funfit and Emotar.

### FUNFIT

This fitness app was large-part narrative based - I adnimated and designed the characters and the environments.

The story is about monsters who tour the earth. Walking certain distances will bring up landmarks that are in the area.

### EMOTAR

Emotar is a photography app that generates 3D avatars to be used on stickers. [Sticker culture](http://a16z.com/2016/06/17/stickers/) is [quite](https://www.wsj.com/articles/line-and-wechat-strike-advertising-gold-1466613181) [popular](https://qz.com/156030/line-is-betting-millions-that-virtual-bears-and-bunnies-will-sweep-the-west/) in Asian messenging apps, including Wechat, Line and KakaoTalk. This app was HTC's effort to get in on the sticker craze.

I was lucky to be given the opportunity to self-direct features. I worked on the user experience design up until the product was shipped.

Formerly, the product architecture had redundant interations. I simplified the system in terms of interactions for a specific goal, boiling the system down to three main goals:

- Changing the Face
- Changing the Sticker (sticker shop)
- Sharing through a messenging app

I worked on the wireframes for 2 cycles of development and created production assets for the released app.
