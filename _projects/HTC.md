	<p><b>HTC</b></p>
	<p>

	Emotar is a mobile app by HTC Research & Development, that aims to help users create personalized stickers for IM apps. </p>

<p>Over the past decade, sticker packs have become <a href="http://a16z.com/2016/06/17/stickers/">integral</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/line-and-wechat-strike-advertising-gold-1466613181">part</a> of  <a href="https://qz.com/156030/line-is-betting-millions-that-virtual-bears-and-bunnies-will-sweep-the-west/">messaging culture</a>, particularly in Asian messaging apps such as Wechat, Line and KakaoTalk. </p>

<p>Emotar takes selfies as input and creates 3D avatars with cartoon animations. </p>

<p>I worked on a redesign of the core mechanics of Emotar as a Product Designer Intern.</p>

		<b>The Problem</b>
		</p>

		<p><blockquote>Design an flexible experience for users that allows for quick creation and sharing.</blockquote></p>
		

		<p class="m-t-xl">
		<b>Design Goals</b>
		</p><p>Out team determined the following design goals from the onset:</p>
<ul>
		<li>Address existing pain points in the sticker creation flow</li>
		<li>Revise the home page to encourage </li>
		<li>Promote branded sharing by making sharing to social networks integral to the experience</li>

		<p><b>Address pain points in the sticker creation flow</b></p>

		<p>User feedback suggested that the lack of reusable components was discouraging users to create new stickers. I revised the creation flow to accomodate editing and re-use of former 3D models.

		<p>A UX researcher and I examined user testing results to discover that the sticker creation model was obfuscated by the existing interface. Affordances like swiping left and right to change stickers are initially unclear. <br><br>In addition, user drop-off was high after creating the first sticker, as users felt like the "Create" button was the only way to make a new sticker.

	<p>I prototyped and tested a solution that makes the entire process modular. Clear delineation is made between the objects and their corresponding interactions. <b>3D avatars</b> are used for the faces of interchangable <b>stickers</b> which are grouped by <b>sets</b>.</p>
	<p>
	The idea is that stickers can be created on-the-fly from components, rather than an arduous linear process. Behaviorally, this is intended to encourage creation and experimentation.

	<p><b>Promote Branded Sharing</b></p>

	<p>Quantitative data revealed the top social networks that our users were attempting to share to. I wanted to make it easier for users to share their stickers on these networks. I protoyped a direct share flow from the home page to various apps. </p>
