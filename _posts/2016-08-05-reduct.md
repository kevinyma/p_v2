Here's a preview of something I've been working on the past month.

<b>REDUCT</b> is a puzzle game for children about evaluating code. [Ian](http://ianarawjo.therottingcartridge.com/) is building the game under Professor Gumbretiere, and I've been assisting with narrative design.

The narrative centers around the genderless Starchild, an alien searching for their home planet. Starchild's ship runs on stardust, obtained by completing levels. This way, Starchild can hop from planet to planet, helping the residents along the way.
