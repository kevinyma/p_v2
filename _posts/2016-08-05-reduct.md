Here's a preview of something I've been working on the past month.

<b>REDUCT</b> is a puzzle game for children about evaluating code. [Ian](http://ianarawjo.therottingcartridge.com/) is building the game under Professor Gumbretiere, and I've been assisting with narrative design.

The story centers around Starchild, an alien hopping from planet to planet in search of their home.

Planets are themed by programming concepts - the physical appearance of a planet's resident is a pseudo- representation of that concept.

Levels teach players concepts bit by bit, untimately combining them. 

Starchild's ship runs on stardust, obtained by completing levels.
