There's that one scene from Ender's Game which always stuck in my imagination:

>The game was a holographic display, and his fighter was represented only by a tiny light. The enemy was
another light of a different color, and they danced and spun and maneuvered through a cube of space that
must have been ten meters to a side.

In science fiction we see vivid pictures of emergent, or soon-to-be emergent technologies. We're not interested in how the technologies work, more than how they work on people. We like to see how they affect our decision making, how they affect our relationships with people.

Certainly, the idea of a room filled with thousands of points of moving light has a poetic appeal. At the same time, a technologist can't help but be drawn to the behavioral and functional implications of such a room. 

In my rapid prototyping class, my team and I were given the opportunity to spend a semester building a physical computing device of our own choosing. We decided to build a 3D arcade game player. 

Low res arcade games seemed to be the perfect fit for the space we wanted to explore. Given peoples' existing knowledge of classic games, we were curious to see how they would behave with the addition of an extra dimension.

The physical implementation of the project was done with a <a href="https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-datasheet/">Particle Photon</a> and 256 <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LED/COM-12877.pdf">RGB addressable LEDS</a> connected in a single daisy chain. The game itself was written in node.js.

Modularity is the name of the game. Jigs allowed us to build and test components separately.

8 LEDs * 8 LEDs * 8 LEDs * 4 solder points per LED = a nightmare

We rigged up an ergonomic controller with two joysticks on a breadboard.

Linna playing Snake3D. The project was well recieved when we demoed it at the Ithaca Science Center.
