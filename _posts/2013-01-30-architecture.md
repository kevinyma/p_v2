Architectural studies as an extension of my interest in physical space and tangible design. Explorations in designing with line and form ensue.

### House with Three Courts

Throughout the 30s, German-American architect Mies van der Rohe was preoccupied with a series of court-house designs. These designs had no client. Rather, they were explorations of space for its own sake.

This project looked at one of these designs extensively: the House with Three Courts. It examined the underlying systems which govern the design, extrapolating and tranforming these systems through a series of iterative models.

### [BODY]/[ARMOR]

We start with a found object, the chest armor of a baseball catcher. If we think of the armor as a set of components which rely on one another to deliver functionality, an organizational heirarchy becomes apparent.

Following a systematic dissection of the object, these armor components (padding foam, stitching, plastic wrapper) began to inform architechtonic elements as structure, superstructure and membrane.

In the final stage of the project, the abstraction was situated on a physical site, as the armor would have been placed on a human body.
